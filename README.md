# GoPrime

To run, after cloning the project from git:
1. Assuming go is installed on your machine, within command line cd into the directory into which you cloned the project (e.g. \Desktop\GoPractice\)
2. ls the folder to ensure main.go is within the folder
3. Run the command go run main.go to start the program.

For simplicity, I've included the test cases within the main package itself. This allowed me to run the program on Go Playground in lieu of setting up a go environment on my work computer. Two of the three tests are designed to succeed, one will fail intentionally. When run, the program will print the results of prime factors for 10 (2, 5, 1).
